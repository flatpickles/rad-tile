# Rad Tile

This will be a lightweight tool for easily making radial tile patterns, like the [Sandbox logo](https://sandbox.is). It's a React app, work in progress.

## short todo:

-   rendering while adding (new dots etc)
-   highlight nearest points before add
-   no parallelograms (holding shift)
-   escape to stop adding
-   fix zooming

## long todo:

-   snapping during add
-   delete tile
-   change repeats around center
-   snap to:
    -   anchor points
    -   angles
