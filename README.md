# Rad Tile

This will be a lightweight tool for easily making radial tile patterns, like the [Sandbox logo](https://sandbox.is). It's a React app, work in progress.

## short todo:

-   escape to stop adding
-   equal side length mode (holding shift)
-   smooth zooming
-   color schemes (randomize)
-   add vs remove (vs pan?) modes
-   confirm no duplicate points (from anchor set)

## long todo:

-   delete tile
-   parameterize: repeats around center
-   snap to angles (adjustable)
-   snap to edges
-   mobile layout
-   more shapes! triangles, equilateral polygons...
-   start with a shape in the center
-   snap relative points in progress tile
