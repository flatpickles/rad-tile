# Rad Tile

This is a lightweight tool for easily making radial tile patterns, like the [Sandbox logo](https://sandbox.is). It's a React app, work in progress!

## short todo:

-   equal side length mode (holding shift)
-   color schemes (randomize?)
-   confirm no duplicate points (from anchor set)
-   remove mode

## long todo:

-   delete tile
-   parameterize: repeats around center
-   snap to angles (adjustable)
-   snap to edges
-   mobile layout & UX
-   better overlap interleaving behavior
-   more shapes! triangles, equilateral polygons...
-   start with a shape in the center
-   snap relative points in progress tile
-   no overlap mode: snap to edges + remove fully utilized anchors
-   persistence (local storage)
