# Rad Tile

This is a lightweight tool for easily making radial tile patterns, like the [Sandbox logo](https://sandbox.is). It's a React app, work in progress!

## short todo:

-   repeat count hotkeys
-   reflect across repeat increments (for even repeat counts)
-   delete tiles (remove mode)
-   equal side length mode (holding shift)
-   color schemes (randomize?)
-   confirm no duplicate points (from anchor set)

## long todo:

-   snap to angles (adjustable)
-   snap to edges (from latest corner)
-   mobile layout & UX
-   better overlap interleaving behavior (3D render w/ tilt, paint ordering)
-   more shapes! triangles, equilateral polygons...
-   start with a shape in the center
-   snap relative points in progress tile
-   no overlap mode: snap to edges + remove fully utilized anchors
-   persistence (local storage)
